# My-City-My-Safety-Anonymous-Crime-Reporting-System
The main goal of this project is to build a more secure, faster, and highly trustworthy platform for reporting suspicious activities to crime-prevention authorities. The system focuses on protecting the identity of the person submitting the tip, preventing tampering of information, and verifying the authenticity of the data being submitted.
